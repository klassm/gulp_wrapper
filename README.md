Gulp Wrapper
===

A wrapper script searching for gulp installation is parent directories. Thus, you can call `gulpw mytask` in any subdirectory.

### Installation

Download `gulpw` into a directory which is available in your `PATH`. Make sure you also have `python3` installed.

### ZSH Autocomplete

Download `plugin/_gulpw` and put it into a directory which is available in `fpath`.

For oh-my-zsh: Add `gulpw` as plugin and put `plugin/_gulpw` to `~/.oh-my-zsh/plugins/gulpw/`. Restart the shell.
